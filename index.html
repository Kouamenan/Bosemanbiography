					Chadwick Boseman was an American actor known for his portrayals of Jackie Robinson in '42' and James Brown in 'Get on Up.' He also played the superhero Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
				</br>Boseman's death impacted me when I learned that he was fighting cancer, his never let the public know and kept fighting and working.
				My mother also lost the fight against cancer and like him, she never let it show and always continued to work and dedicate herself to what she liked despite the grueling treatment. My mother was my hero and she might as well have been in this site here in Boseman's place.

		<span>Boseman passed away on August 28, 2020, from colon cancer. "It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman," a statement posted on his social media accounts read. "Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV. A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much."
		</br>“A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much,” his family said in a statement. “From Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson’s Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and several more — all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honor of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in Black Panther. He died in his home, with his wife and family by his side."
		</br>A memorial service was held in Malibu, California the following weekend.
